  This website is part of a much larger project for <a href='http://amresorts.com/' target='_blank'>AMResorts</a>. The goal is to create websites, with a mobile first approach, for all of their properties to act as an on location tool for their guests. The different websites for each hotel will also be combined into a mobile app, via PhoneGap, available on iPhone and Android. Through the app, users will have added functionality such as international calling.
  This was an interesting project because it combined so many different brands, all under AMResorts, like <a href='http://www.secretsresorts.com/' target='_blank'>Secrets</a>, <a href='http://www.nowresorts.com/' target='_blank'>Now</a>, and <a href='http://www.dreamsresorts.com/' target='_blank'>Dreams</a>. It was necessary to balance the difference in each of their branding and at the same time make the sites and apps feel unified.
