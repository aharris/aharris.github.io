      "During my time at Carrier, I had the opportunity to lead a diverse team consisting of developers, designers, QA engineers, project managers, and researchers. Each team member brought their unique skills and perspectives to the project, and I was responsible for ensuring that everyone was working together efficiently and effectively towards a common goal. This required strong communication and collaboration skills, as well as the ability to manage multiple workstreams and track progress across different teams. As the lead, I had to ensure that all team members were aligned with the project's objectives and that they were making progress towards their goals. I am proud to say that our team's efforts resulted in a high-quality project that met all of Carrier's requirements. Leading such a diverse team was a challenging but incredibly rewarding experience, and I am grateful for the opportunity to work with such talented and dedicated individuals at Carrier."
